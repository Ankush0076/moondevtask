## Reasons for Breaking Up a Large Component File

### Enhanced Readability and Maintainability
- Smaller components are easier to understand and maintain.
- Promotes separation of concerns, making the codebase more manageable.

### Reusability
- Smaller components can be reused across different parts of the application or other projects.
- Encourages a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach, speeding up development.

### Improved Performance
- Smaller components allow for optimized rendering and updates.
- Enhances application performance, especially in dynamic user interfaces.
